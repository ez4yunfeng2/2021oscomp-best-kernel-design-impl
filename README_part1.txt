/*******Project2 (part1)*******/

This part is to implement process scheduler and mutex lock.
You can define your process in a .c file and put it under /test2_project2 and:
STEP1: Modify test2.h, test.h and test.c to make sure its entry_point and task_type are accessible.
STEP2: Change macro TASK_GROUP.

Note:
1.In this part, every process' status can be RUNNING, READY or BLOCKED. (can't be killed)
2.Non-preemptive scheduler.
3.NO exception and interruption handler.
